Ruby On Rails : <br />
Ruby on Rails, or simply Rails, is a web application framework written in Ruby under MIT License. Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages

Django : <br />
Django is a free and open-source web framework, written in Python, which follows the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern.It is maintained by the Django Software Foundation (DSF), an independent organization established as a non-profit.

Django Front-end : Developer use django for call restful api rails show to users,also control data with Jquery , CSS , ReactJS , etc <br />
Rails  Back-end  : Developer use model  , controller(save , delete , insert , edit) with Rest-API(gem install rest-api) 

### Restful: <br />

Much like Web Services, a REST service is:

Platform-independent (you don't care if the server is Unix, the client is a Mac, or anything else),
Language-independent (C# can talk to Java, etc.), <br />
Standards-based (runs on top of HTTP), and <br />
Can easily be used in the presence of firewalls. <br />

### What is Rest : <br />

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. (It is sometimes spelled "ReST".) It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol -- and in virtually all cases, the HTTP protocol is used.

REST is an architecture style for designing networked applications. The idea is that, rather than using complex mechanisms such as CORBA, RPC or SOAP to connect between machines, simple HTTP is used to make calls between machines.
